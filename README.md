### OUTLINE

This package includes a collection of ASP encodings for solving the Curriculum-Based Course
Timetabling (CB-CTT) Problem.
The CB-CTT problem has been used in the second International Timetabling
Competition (ITC-2007).

### REQUIREMENTS
- [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) (version 5 or higher)

### OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- Perl 3 for decoding answer sets to solutions of ITC competition format
- C++ for validating solutions of ITC competition format

### USAGE

```
% clingo teaspoon.lp ud1.lp bench/Test_asp/toy.lp  > toy.log
% ./bin/decode.perl toy.log > toy.sol
% cat toy.sol

### NOTE
This package includes the program `bin/validator.cc` that validates a
solution for a CB-CTT instance for all the five formulations. This
program was developed by Andrea Schaerf and Luca Di Gaspero.
